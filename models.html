            <img src="Slike/slika718.jpg" alt="Model 1">
            <p class="car_name">718</p>
            <p>The 718 models are made for sport. These are mid-engined roadsters that combine the sporty spirit of the legendary Porsche 718 with the sports car of tomorrow - and transfer it to the roads of today's world. With one goal: to provide a different and exciting feeling every time you ride.</p>

            <img src="Slike/slika911.jpg" alt="Model 2">
            <p class="car_name">911</p>
            <p>Clear line. Elegant. Purist. Unmistakable: in 1963, F.A. Porsche achieved great success with the silhouette of the 911 model. With refined lines and the unity of form and function. More than 50 years later, the world knows many sports cars. But there is only one 911.</p>

            <img src="Slike/slikataycan.jpg" alt="Model 3">
            <p class="car_name">Taycan</p>
            <p>The soul has many aspects. It is changeable and constantly changing. When you look at the Porsche Taycan, it reveals itself with a smile that expresses complete delight. Or the urge for freedom behind the wheel of the new Taycan Cross Turismo model, which has its own story, even away from everyday life.</p>

        <div class="model">
            <img src="Slike/slikapanarema.jpg" alt="Model 4">
            <p class="car_name">Panarema</p>
            <p>The Panamera is intended for people who take advantage of their freedom to follow their instincts. To people who express themselves in the way they travel, not just in arriving at their destination. To people who make decisions based on their own desires, not what others think. We built this sports car just for those people.</p>

        <div class="model">
            <img src="Slike/slikamacan.jpg" alt="Model 5">
            <p class="car_name">Macan</p>
            <p>Five doors, five seats, but incomparable, unmistakable and unstoppable. In its latest generation, the Macan is and remains a sports car among compact SUVs. Porsche DNA is immediately recognizable in the sloping roof line: the so-called the "flyline" line gives the Macan the characteristic contours of a sports car.</p>

        <div class="model">
            <img src="Slike/slikacayenne.jpg" alt="Model 6">
            <p class="car_name">Cayenne</p>
            <p>More than 20 years ago, we wondered if a sports car could celebrate more than an individual. Cayenne provided the answer. And he continues to improve it to this day. For people who want to walk their own path. Today to the office, tomorrow to an off-road drive or to the race track ‚Äì the Cayenne provides driving pleasure on all terrains, combined with a design typical of the Porsche brand.
